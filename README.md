Netflix Recommendation System
This project implements a Netflix Recommendation System using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to provide personalized movie recommendations. It decomposes the user-movie rating matrix into latent factors, capturing user preferences and movie characteristics. Missing ratings are predicted by reconstructing the matrix, and movies with the highest predicted scores are recommended.

Key Features:
Matrix Factorization with SVD to uncover hidden patterns in user behavior.
Prediction of missing ratings for personalized recommendations.
Efficient and scalable for large datasets like Netflix.
This system balances accuracy and performance, making it a strong foundation for advanced recommendation models. ðŸš€
